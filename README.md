# PyUnoGame
This is my one-week project, what i made for Yandex Academy Lyceum

# How to start it?
Firstly, start a server, what you can find at server/main.py. You need to change global SERVER_IP in this file to your loopback, local or even global IP.

Next, you need to start a client's. You need to change global SERVER_IP here too. Now just register, and play a game with your friend (or with yourself, if you doesnt have friends like me)
